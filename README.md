## üåç Introduction to the problem and the solution
In industrial automation, ensuring worker safety and maintaining optimal machine performance are critical priorities. Factories require solutions to continuously monitor environmental conditions, prevent hazards, and enhance safety.  

**Air Quality and Machine Safety Monitoring System** is an IoT-based solution designed to provide real-time air quality monitoring and safety alerts for industrial environments.  

The system uses the ESP32 microcontroller, MQ-135 gas sensor, and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to monitor air quality and worker proximity to machinery. Data is visualized via the Blynk app, enabling remote monitoring and control for enhanced factory safety management.

## üîß Hardware Design and Implementation
The system integrates the following components:

### 1. **ESP32 Microcontroller**
- Serves as the main processing unit.
- Handles Wi-Fi communication for data transmission to the Blynk platform.

### 2. **MQ-135 Gas Sensor**
- Detects harmful gases, including CO, CO‚ÇÇ, NH‚ÇÉ, and CH‚ÇÑ.
- Continuously monitors air quality by relaying data to the ESP32.

### 3. **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**
- Measures the distance between workers and machinery.
- Ensures safety by identifying unsafe proximity.

### 4. **Output Devices**
- **LEDs and Buzzers**: Provide visual and audible alerts for unsafe conditions.  

The ESP32 collects data from the sensors and transmits it to the Blynk platform via Wi-Fi. If any unsafe conditions are detected (e.g., poor air quality or proximity hazards), the system triggers alerts through LEDs and buzzers.

## üåê Network Infrastructure
The system uses the following communication setup:
- **Wi-Fi Connection**: The ESP32 connects to the internet and sends data to the Blynk platform.
- **Blynk Application**: Provides real-time data visualization and control.  

### Key Functionalities via Blynk:
- View air quality and proximity data.
- Receive real-time alerts for unsafe conditions.
- Remotely adjust safety parameters.  

Wi-Fi credentials (SSID, password) and the Blynk authentication token are securely configured in the source code.

## üíª Software Implementation Details
The system is implemented using **FreeRTOS** to manage multiple tasks concurrently. Key tasks include:

### 1. **Gas Sensor Reading Task**
- Reads data from the MQ-135 sensor.
- Checks gas concentration against predefined safety thresholds.

### 2. **Ultrasonic Sensor Reading Task**
- Monitors worker proximity to machinery.
- Triggers alerts when the distance falls below a safe range.

### 3. **Wi-Fi and Blynk Task**
- Maintains a stable Wi-Fi connection.
- Sends sensor data to the Blynk platform for remote monitoring.

### 4. **Alert Task**
- Activates LEDs and buzzers for visual and audible warnings.  

To avoid task conflicts, mutexes are used for synchronized access to shared resources.

## üìä Test Results and Performance Evaluation
The system has been thoroughly tested in a simulated factory environment.  

### Key Observations:
1. Successfully detects harmful gases such as CO, CO‚ÇÇ, NH‚ÇÉ, and CH‚ÇÑ using the MQ-135 sensor.
2. Measures safe working distances with the HC-SR04 sensor.
3. Provides early warnings through buzzers and visualizes real-time data on the Blynk app.  

Some inconsistencies in sensor readings were observed, primarily due to hardware quality limitations. However, overall system performance is reliable and effective.

## üîÆ Conclusion and Future Work
The **Air Quality and Machine Safety Monitoring System** offers a practical and cost-effective solution to enhance industrial safety. By leveraging the ESP32 microcontroller, MQ-135 gas sensor, and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, the system monitors air quality and provides safety alerts in real time.  

### Future Enhancements:
1. Incorporate more precise sensors for higher accuracy.
2. Add support for monitoring multiple machines simultaneously.
3. Implement machine learning to predict equipment failures and enable predictive maintenance.  

This system demonstrates the potential of IoT in transforming industrial safety standards.
